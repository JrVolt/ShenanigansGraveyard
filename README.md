# Shenanigans Graveyard
*All the shit I've made in years*

---

## Overview

Welcome to **Shenanigans Graveyard**, a carefully curated collection of **tiny, messy, probably broken scripts** I've accumulated over the years. Each script was created for a very **specific use case** — often a fleeting problem or a one-off experiment — and there is **no support** whatsoever.  

The main purpose of this repository is simple:

- Keep track of all the shit.
- Preserve a historical snapshot of my chaotic coding adventures.
- Serve as a cautionary tale for anyone who dares to dive in.

---

## Organization

Scripts are loosely organized into folders based on vague categories. There is **no global documentation**, and there will likely **never be**. If a script has notes or instructions, they are in the **folder itself**, usually next to the script.  

Expect:

- Inconsistent naming conventions
- Messy code
- Deprecated hacks
- Surprising discoveries

---

## Usage

Use at your own risk. Scripts may:

- Break your system
- Do nothing at all
- Require mental gymnastics to understand

This repository is **not meant for production**. It is purely archival, experimental, and occasionally educational — if you can decipher the mess.
